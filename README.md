********ï»¿ViterbiNet python implementation********

This project implements a ViterbiNet-based symbol detector for communication systems with noise. It is designed to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of accuracy and Bit Error Rate (BER) under different SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) conditions.

To run the simulation, do python main.py. This runs the algorithm on a range of L and SNR values, specified at the top of main.py. To graph the SNR and l results, do python graphs.py. A viterbinet_results.csv, as generated by main, must be present.
